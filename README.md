Employee attrition is one of the major issues faced by companies in recent times due to unpredictable markets and an unyielding workforce. It can be described as the departure of employees from an organization due to reasons other than termination of employment by the organization. It can occur due to a multitude of reasons such as incompetent environment, unsatisfactory compensation, physical factors such as duration of work, location, not enough opportunity for personal and professional
growth etc. A high attrition rate would signify that more employees leave the organization than those being recruited. This can be harmful for the organization in several ways.

1. Reduction in employee morale due to insecurity and confusion surrounding mass departure.
2. Hit to the brand reputation of the organization for not being able to satisfy their employees.
3. Transfer of resources to prevent high attrition rates when they were originally meant for business functions.
4. Decrease in quality of workforce due to departure of premium and senior employees.

Our project aims to achieve two outcomes:
1. To build a model to predict the exit of an employee
2. To devise a retention strategy which allows organizations to retain their employees.
